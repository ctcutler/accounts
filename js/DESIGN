What's the balance of a particular account (including all children) at any given time?

How does the balance of an account change over time?

For now let's assume that building a chart's data requires a pass over the parsed data.  That's certainly simplest.

So at import time we just create an in memory representation of the journal and then when we want to show a chart we do a pass over the journal looking for relevant transactions.

So import creates something like this:
[
  {
    date: 123123123,
    desc: 'foo bar',
    postings: {
      'Assets:Foo:Bar': {
        quantity: 123.45,
        commodity: '$',
      },
      ...
    }
  },
  ...
}

Note we assume one posting per account in each transaction. Ledger may allow more but this makes it easier/faster to look up postings based on what we care about.

Pulling chart data out of the journal, then, is a matter of zipping through the transactions looking for ones with postings relevant to the account we're charting.
